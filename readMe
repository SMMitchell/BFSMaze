HOW TO RUN THE BREADTH FIRST SEARCH MAZE SOLVING PROGRAM: 

********************** GENERATE THE MAZE **************************


STEP 1:  Compile Maze Generator using command line argument: 

javac MazeGenerator.java


STEP 2:  Run Maze Generator Program using command line argument: 

Type java MazeGenerator followed by the amount Rows and Columns 
for the maze and the desired file name.

Example:

java MazeGenerator 5 6 maze.dat

will produce a maze with 5 rows and 6 columns, then save it to
a file called "maze.dat"

A new Maze will then be generated and displayed, along with 
a successful notification containing the new Maze file name.

* If either the number of Rows or Columns exceeds 10 the maze 
* will not be displayed. 



************************* SOLVE THE MAZE ***************************

STEP 1:  Compile Maze Generator using command line argument:

javac MazeSolverBFS.java


STEP 2: Run Maze Generator Program using command line argument:

Type java MazeSolverBFS followed by the filename you would like to use

Example:

java MazeSolverBFS maze.data 

this would solve the maze generated in the example above

The maze from the file will now be solved and will present the following
information:

Each cell visited in the optimal solution, in the order they were traversed, 
beginning with the Start Node.

The number of steps taken in the optimal solution

the number of steps taken in the Breadth First Search

The number of seconds taken to solve the maze.

A display of the maze if either dimension does not exceed 10
